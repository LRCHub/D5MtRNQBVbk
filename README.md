[00:12.88] Days go by
[00:15.52] And I'm not feeling better
[00:18.47] Coffee's always bitter
[00:20.60] If it even has a taste
[00:31.60] 
[00:23.97] And I know why
[00:26.73] So watch me get a haircut
[00:29.66] I know every shortcut
[00:31.96] to avoid the pain
[00:40.46] 
[00:33.62] So I don't have to feel
[00:35.19] what I need to feel
[00:36.43] I keep running from myself
[00:49.43] 
[00:39.52] I don't have to feel
[00:40.77] what I need to feel
[00:41.93] I keep running from myself
[00:54.93] 
[00:44.63] But there's just no moving mountains
[00:48.45] You're bound to lose
[00:51.13] Gotta let the rain pour down
[00:54.10] to see the BLUE
[01:01.60] 
[00:56.90] No point in walking around it
[00:59.69] If you wanna get out
[01:01.36] You gotta go through
[01:04.26] You gotta go through
[01:06.94] You gotta go through
[01:09.85] You gotta go through
[01:19.85] 
[01:14.85] Fake a smile
[01:17.43] 난 웃어야만 했고
[01:20.38] 떨리는 숨은 삼켜내
[01:22.98] 들키지 않도록
[01:26.48] 
[01:26.00] Stuck in BLUE
[01:28.84] 언젠간 지나겠지
[01:31.80] Force a little patience
[01:33.97] But I stay in bed
[01:42.47] 
[01:35.66] So I don't have to feel
[01:37.18] what I need to feel
[01:38.57] I keep running from myself
[01:51.57] 
[01:41.53] So I don't have to feel
[01:42.80] what I need to feel
[01:44.03] I keep running from myself
[01:57.03] 
[01:46.70] But there's just no moving mountains
[01:50.53] You're bound to lose
[01:53.23] Gotta let the rain pour down
[01:56.15] to see the BLUE
[02:03.65] 
[01:58.84] No point in walking around it
[02:01.82] If you wanna get out
[02:03.46] You gotta go through
[02:06.29] You gotta go through
[02:08.97] You gotta go through
[02:11.89] You gotta go through
[02:21.89] 
[02:14.98] Yeah You gotta go
[02:16.65] You gotta go
[02:17.99] You gotta go through
[02:20.84] You gotta go
[02:22.22] You gotta go
[02:23.63] You gotta go through
[02:33.63] 
[02:26.38] I keep walking
[02:28.17] 여전히 겨울에 잠겨
[02:30.85] It's too tight to breath
[02:32.26] But I've been holding back my cries
[02:35.16] That's why I can't sleep at night
[02:51.66] 
[02:41.24] It's just no moving mountains
[02:44.11] You're bound to lose
[02:46.87] Gotta let the rain pour down
[02:49.62] to see the BLUE
[02:57.12] 
[02:52.57] No point in walking around it
[02:55.43] If you wanna get out
[02:57.08] You gotta go through
[02:59.91] You gotta go through
[03:02.65] You gotta go through
[03:05.42] You gotta go through
[03:15.42] 
[03:08.51] Yeah You gotta go
[03:10.16] You gotta go
[03:11.57] You gotta go through
[03:14.56] You gotta go
[03:15.82] You gotta go
[03:17.38] You gotta go through
[03:27.38] 
[03:19.82] Yeah You gotta go
[03:21.60] You gotta go
[03:22.94] You gotta go through
